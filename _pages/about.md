<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Jinyu Tian (田晋宇), a final-year undergraduate student at the College of Cryptology and Cyber Science, Nankai University (南开大学), supervised by Prof. Xiang Li (李翔). Currently, I am a visiting student at the Shanghai Innovation Institute (上海创智学院). I am honored to share that I will be joining Fudan University (复旦大学) in 2026 to pursue my Ph.D. degree, under the supervision of Prof. Xipeng Qiu (邱锡鹏).

During my undergraduate studies, my research primarily focused on AI4Researchers, aiming to empower the scientific community with intelligent tools. Currently, my research interests have evolved towards Multimodal Understanding and Generation, with a goal of building more versatile and creative AI systems.
